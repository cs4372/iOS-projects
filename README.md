# iOS-Projects

This is a collection of projects that aims to solidify my understanding of the fundamental concepts in iOS development.

#### [Auto-Layout-Programmatically](https://github.com/cs4372/ios-projects/tree/master/Auto-Layout-Programmatically)
- This application allows users to swipe pages between views. It demostrates the basic implementation of UICollectionView, Paging, Programmatic UI views and Auto Layout.

#### [Bucket List Hotels](https://github.com/cs4372/ios-projects/tree/master/Bucket-List-Hotels)
- This app displays a list of hotels with their basic information fetched from a JSON file. When a user clicks on a hotel cell, it displays the hotel's detailed information, including address, phone number, description, and a map view showing the hotel's location. It showcases the implementation of key features and concepts such as UITableView, DiffableDataSource, Segues, Tap Gesures, Geolocation and MapKit.

#### [Budget App](https://github.com/cs4372/ios-projects/tree/master/Budget-App)
- It is a budget and expense tracker that helps users manage their finances by creating a budget plan and keeping track of their expenses. I used Charts which is a third party library to create customizable bar charts for the expenses and Core Data to store permanent data for offline use.
